The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset catalogs the microbial species that colonize human navels. It reveals that a small subset of microbial species, also known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), are common, with more than 70% of individuals hosting these microbes. The remaining microbial species are relatively rare. This dataset allows researchers to study microbial diversity and understand patterns of microbial presence in human navels.

The purpose of the dataset aims to explore the biodiversity of microbes inhabiting a specific part of the human body (the navel). It provides an opportunity to investigate patterns of microbial distribution and their prevalence across individuals. Key observations include a small group of microbial species dominates the dataset, appearing in over 70% of participants. Rare microbial species form the majority, suggesting that microbial diversity is high, but these rare species are less consistently present.

The interactive dashboard built from this dataset allows users to explore the abundance of specific microbial species, how microbial diversity varies across individuals, and patterns in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between common and rare species.

The horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 OTUs by abundance for the selected individual. The x-axis represents the sample values (abundance), while the y-axis corresponds to the OTU IDs. Hovering over the bars reveals the OTU labels, providing insight into the most dominant microbial species.

The bubble chart offers a comprehensive view of all OTUs within a sample. The x-axis displays OTU IDs, while the y-axis represents their abundance. Each bubbleâ€™s size correlates with the abundance of the OTU, and its color signifies a unique OTU ID.

The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset reveals a highly diverse microbial ecosystem, with a small core of common microbes shared among most individuals and a wide variety of rare species. Through interactive visualizations, such as bar and bubble charts, the dataset highlights the variability in microbial abundance and distribution across individuals. These findings not only deepen our understanding of microbial ecology but also hint at the potential for personalized applications in health and hygiene.

The interactive dashboard serves as a powerful tool to engage researchers, educators, and the public, encouraging exploration of microbial diversity and its implications in human biology and beyond. This study underscores the vast complexity of the human microbiome and its relevance to science, health, and ecology.
